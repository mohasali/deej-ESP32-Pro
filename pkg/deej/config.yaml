# process names are case-insensitive
# you can use 'master' to indicate the master channel, or a list of process names to create a group
# you can use 'mic' to control your mic input level (uses the default recording device)
# you can use 'deej.unmapped' to control all apps that aren't bound to any slider (this ignores master, system, mic and device-targeting sessions) (experimental)
# windows only - you can use 'deej.current' to control the currently active app (whether full-screen or not) (experimental)
# windows only - you can use a device's full name, i.e. "Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)", to bind it. this works for both output and input devices
# windows only - you can use 'system' to control the "system sounds" volume
# important: slider indexes start at 0, regardless of which analog pins you're using!

# use keyboard. follwed by a keyboard key
# look at button.go for the list of keys
# you can open a file by giving the file location
# use / when giving a file location in both windows and linux
# buttons just run a cmd line so you can basically do anything with it.
# just like in sliders you can list commands for a button to execute
